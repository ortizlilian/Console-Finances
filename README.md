# Bootcamp Challenge `4`: Console Finances

This repo contains a single page website with a JavaScript file that generates a financial report based on the data passed to it through an array called finances.

This application will eventually be improved in the future in order to both display the financial report directly onto the index.html file and accept inputs from inputs fields embedded in the hmtl.

The website was deployed using GitHub Pages and can be viewed [here](https://ortizlilian.github.io/Console-Finances/).

## Mockup

## Acceptance Criteria

* When the page is loaded the page presents your name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about you, your work, and how to contact you
* When one of the links in the navigation is clicked then the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
* When viewing the section about your work then the section contains titled images of your applications
* When presented with the your first application then that application's image should be larger in size than the others
* When images of the applications are clicked then the user is taken to that deployed application
* When the page is resized or viewed on various screens and devices then the layout is responsive and adapts to my viewport
