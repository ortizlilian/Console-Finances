Tool to analyse financial records of a company

# Bootcamp Challenge `4`: Console Finances

This repo contains a single page website with a JavaScript file that generates a financial report based on the data passed to it through an array called finances.

This application will eventually be improved in the future in order to both display the financial report directly onto the index.html file and accept inputs from inputs fields embedded in the hmtl.

The website was deployed using GitHub Pages and can be viewed [here](https://ortizlilian.github.io/Console-Finances/).

## Mockup

This is what the website looks like.
